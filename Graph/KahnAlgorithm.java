/*
kahn Algorithm

For Topological Sort using BFS, Kahn's Algorithm is used.

The algorithm works on in-degree and out-degree of vertices.

It is based on the fact that, in Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG), there is at least one vertex with
in-degree = 0, and one vertex with out-degree = 0.

For Topological Sort using BFS, boolean[] vis is not required, because after popping out a
vertex, it decreases the in-degree of its neighbors by 1. hence, only those vertices with
in-degree = 0 will be taken. In-degree = 0 implies that, it cannot be visited again, hence no
boolean[] vis is required.
