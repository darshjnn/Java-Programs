/*
Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG) is a directed graph with no cycles.

Topological sorting is used only for DAGs (not for non-DAGs).

Topological Sort works on Dependency Graph.

It is a linear order of vertices such that every directed edge u -> v,
the vertex u comes before v in the order.

Time Complexity of Topological Sort: O(V + E).

For Topological Sort using BFS, Kahn's Algorithm is used.
The algorithm works on in-degree and out-degree of vertices.
It is based on the fact that, in Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG), there is at least one vertex with
in-degree = 0, and one vertex with out-degree = 0.
